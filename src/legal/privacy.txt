1. Information We Collect
We collect various types of personal information from you to provide and continuously improve our services. The information we collect falls into the following categories:
Identifiers: This includes information you provide when you create an account, make a booking, or sign up for a membership. Examples are your full name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and unique identifiers we may assign to you, such as a customer or membership ID. We may also collect your date of birth to verify eligibility for services or to confirm you are of legal age.
Payment Information: We collect information necessary to process your transactions securely. This includes credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, security codes, and billing addresses. We do not store full credit card numbers on our servers; this data is securely handled by our third-party payment processors. We also maintain a detailed history of your transactions with us, including purchases of simulator bookings, lessons, merchandise, and beverages.
Commercial Information: We track your purchasing and consuming histories to better understand your preferences and improve our offerings. This includes records of services you have purchased (e.g., specific lessons or training packages), products you have considered (e.g., items you've added to a cart), and your general purchasing tendencies. This information helps us to tailor future promotions and product recommendations to you.
Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information: When you interact with our website or online booking systems, we automatically collect certain information. This includes your browsing history, search history, and information about your interaction with our website, such as pages viewed and time spent. We use technologies like cookies, IP addresses, web beacons, and other device identifiers to collect this data. This information helps us analyze website traffic, diagnose server issues, and personalize your online experience.
Audio, Electronic, Visual, or Similar Information: For the safety and security of all patrons and staff, and for liability purposes, our physical facilities are under continuous video surveillance. This includes CCTV recordings of our common areas, simulators, and entrance/exit points. These recordings are used to prevent and investigate theft, monitor for property damage, and to document incidents of injury or other liabilities. Access to this information is strictly limited and is not used for purposes of individual tracking or performance analysis.
Professional or Employment-Related Information: If you are booking a corporate event or have a corporate membership, we may collect information you provide about your employer or professional title to facilitate those services.

2. How We Use Your Information
We use the personal information we collect for the following business purposes, all of which are directly related to the provision and improvement of our services:
To Provide Services and Fulfill Orders: We use your information to process your simulator, lesson, and training bookings, manage your membership account, and fulfill your orders for merchandise and beverages. This includes sending you booking confirmations, receipts, and order updates.
To Communicate With You: We use your contact information to communicate with you about your account, bookings, or inquiries. With your consent, we may also send you marketing communications about new products, services, or special promotions. You can opt out of these promotional communications at any time.
For Security and Safety: The CCTV recordings and other security-related data we collect are used to ensure a safe environment for everyone at our facilities. We use this information to protect our property from theft and damage, to investigate incidents and claims of injury or misconduct, and to provide evidence for law enforcement as needed.
To Improve and Personalize Our Services: We analyze your usage patterns and commercial information to better understand the needs and preferences of our patrons. This allows us to make data-driven decisions to enhance our offerings, optimize the user experience on our website, and tailor our marketing efforts to better serve your interests.
To Process Payments and Prevent Fraud: We use your payment and commercial information to securely process your transactions and to screen for potentially fraudulent activity.
For Legal and Compliance Purposes: We may use your personal information to comply with legal obligations, enforce our Terms of Service, and defend ourselves against legal claims. This includes, but is not limited to, responding to subpoenas, warrants, or other legal processes from government or law enforcement agencies.

3. How We Share Your Information
We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA), certain forms of data sharing may be considered a "sale" or "sharing" for cross-context behavioral advertising. We may share your personal information with the following categories of third parties for business purposes:
Service Providers: We engage trusted third-party companies that perform essential services on our behalf. This includes payment processors (e.g., for secure transaction handling), website hosting providers, analytics partners, and marketing and advertising partners. These service providers are contractually obligated to use your personal information only for the purpose of providing the services we request and are not permitted to use it for their own purposes.
Legal and Regulatory Authorities: We may disclose your personal information to government agencies, law enforcement, or courts when we have a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, to protect our rights or property, or to ensure the safety of our patrons or the public.
Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal information may be transferred to the new owner as part of that transaction. You will be notified of any such event and any changes to the privacy policy.
Anonymized and Aggregated Data: We may share de-identified or aggregated data with third parties for business and marketing purposes. This data cannot be used to identify you personally and is not considered personal information under this Policy.
